# Graphiy Behavior
This is a collection of Objects handling user interactions with a canvas:
- Pan - move the whole canvas horizontally and vertically
- Select
  - select on click
  - select multiple with Ctrl key pressed
  - Rectangular selection - group selection by drawing a rectangle
  - Lasso selection - group selection by drawing a free form
- Drag - drag selected items relative to the canvas with pointer
- Zoom - resize canvas and items in it proportionally

It's dual-licensed under both GPLv3 and a [commercial license for proprietary projects](https://github.com/Graphiy/kms>).

## TODO
- randomize initial position of nodes
- fix offset for dragged element when clicking on child of node for each the event is set
- Zoom
- Rectangular selection
- Lasso selection
